welcome in everyone my name is Robbie I'll by the name closing dime in today's episode we're going to talk about positive expected value and how to calculated it now in the past videos we did talk about the concepts of what positive expected value is we talked about implied win probability we talked about the viig and a bunch of other things in this video we're going to use that information to calculate an expected value of a bet or some type of event that we have assigned a win probability for so by assigning an implied win probability and correlating that with a certain set of odds that you might find on a sports book we can get a expected value now sometimes that could be negative and sometimes that could be positive obviously as Sports bets who are looking to make a profit we are looking for positive expected value bets the expected value formula is very simple it's basically how much money you're expected to win versus how much money you're expected to lose based on your implied win probability and the odds that you bet it at now expected value is used by any advantage players whether you're trading in the stock market on a blackjack table or even uh playing poker that's used basically across all the industries to determine how much money you can make by placing certain bets or making certain decisions now this is really important because you can actually calculate exactly how much money you will make uh on each bet so if I'm placing a bet for $100 and it has a 3% expected value then I know I expected to make 3% on that $100 long term so every time I place a bet with a 3% expected value for $100 I know my profit longterm will be $3 and that might sound like a small number but when you can bet a hundred times a day or thousand times a month these add these numbers add up really quick it is also a really cool exercise to do is to see how much money you are making per hour by betting on sports with a certain expected value and a certain wager size so we can get into that exercise a little later because it's a it's a fun exercise to do to see how much money basically I've made per click on a sports book and also how much money I can make per hour if I sat down and was sports betting for an hour if you're betting on a sports book pretty much blind your expected value is just going to be that Vig percentage that the sports books are charging so if you're betting into a market that has 7% in VI added to it your expected value is going to be negative 7% Roi for you positive 7% Roi for the books so just a quick explanation of that now I'll actually break down the math behind me we'll go over the actual formula and lay this out very clearly so that everyone can understand it all right we have the Whiteboard pulled up here we're going to solve for the expected value for this example and then after this example I will show you my basically hourly rate that I can determine based on my expected value and how you could calculate your hourly rate if you were sports betting a certain expected value and then also I will go over my history of sports betting and see how much money I've made per click this is something I haven't even done yet so it'll be fun to do at the end of this video but right now let's look at this expected value formula here and it's pretty simple so EV equals the implied win probability or your percent of winning this bet and that's going going to be determined by either a model you predicted let's just say for this example we're talking about the Celtics and let's just say our model predicted that the Celtics are going to win this game 50% of the time that would be our Our Winning probability of the Celtics winning correct and you can also get this implied win probability from the fair value of sharp books like cira bookmaker Pinnacle um we talked about that in the last video as a top down better my implied win probabilities come from other sports books like the sharp books like Pinnacle Circ and bookmaker so finding the implied win probability of the event is really the hardest thing to do all the math and stuff afterwards kind of just fills it in so for this example we got Celtics to win 50% of the time whatever way we found that it's 50% of and then we multiply that by the profit if our bet won so we got this bet at plus 110 odds so our profit would be $210 and then we subtract it by the losing impli probability which means it's the opposite of your winning which happens to be the same here maybe 50% wasn't the best number but since we are going to win this bet 50% of the time that means we are losing the bet 50% of the time as well so we take the losing percentage and we multiply it by how much we will lose so in this example we will just say that we are staking a $100 wager so that's how much money we would lose obviously if our bet won whatever we wagered is going to be gone so let's fill in the blanks here for this equation so we already kind of talked about it but the win percent is 50% as a decimal .5 losing is also 50% should have picked some different numbers like I said profit will be $210 sorry it's just going to be $110 um because we would get 210 back but we wagered 100 so profit is going to equal it would be $110 in profit with those odds and if we lose we are going to lose 100 so pretty simple here we'll pull out the calculator and solve each of this side of the equation here so we have 0.5 times the profit which is

110 and then we're going to subtract that by the losing percentage which is also 50% times that one by

100 and then let's break this down further uh .5 * 110 proba hold it closer will be $55 so we have $55 here minus the other side of the

equation which will also be 0.5 * 100 which will be

50 pretty simple from there so our EV is going to equal 55 minus 50 so our expected value is going to be $5 of profit because we are betting $100 at 50% win probability and we're getting plus 110 odds we are expected to make $5 every time we place a bet like this now obviously if you're only placing one bet at a time you're either going to win 110 or you're going to lose 100 but the expected value is what you're expected to make longterm if you place this wager 1,000 times with that implied win probability those odds you were expected to make $5 and if you wanted to even break that break this down a little bit further um $5 of your original $100 wager is 5% so this would this bet would be a five% positive expected value bet which would be an awesome bet to make so let's break down the math of some of my own uh sports betting profits and yeah we'll just break that down a little bit all right let's just give a quick example here of how to determine your hourly rate or how much money you can place while you're positive sports betting so let's use a 3% return on investment or a 3% expected value on every bet now I've been betting for a couple of years now and my average is 3.5% expected value or 3.5% Roi on my bets so to be a little bit more conservative let's just say you can make uh 3% on every bet that you place right and also to make this easy let's just say you are betting $100 a bet now that typically means that you know your bets are typically 1% of your bankroll size so that would assume that you have a $10,000 bankroll if you are betting $100 per bet so obviously if we do 3% of 100 then that is going to give us or $100 that's going to give us $3 so basically means every bet we place with a 3% Edge we're going to have $3 a profit so now we can figure out how many bets you can get down per hour at about this Eevee percentage so I would argue that if I was in front of a screen during a pretty busy part of the Year let's just say during NBA season right before game time I could probably sit down at my computer put one hour work and and get at least 20 bets down so if I can do 20 bets at $3 a profit per hour well we're doing some really simple math here then my hourly ra wage is I'm going to be expected to make $60 an hour while I'm placing Sports bets like this now the thing with probabilities and expected value is I'm not going to walk away every hour and make $60 some some hours I'm going to lose 300 some days I'm going or some hours I'm going to win 500 so in the end it all comes out to about that 3% % range or that $60 an hour all right and here's the real simple math on how much I've made per bet in the past two years these are all publicly tracked on picket so this is everything that picket is showing um I've made 58,7 77 in the past two years on 27,36 bets so let's see how much that is per click of a sports book so I'm taking my profit five uh 58,000 [Music] 77791 we're dividing it by how many bets I placed how many clicks on the sports books I had so two 7 3 69 so every time I click a placed bet on a sports book myself am expected to make or I have made not expected uh pretty much $24 which doesn't sound like much but if you're able to pump out volume like 27 th000 bets in a year or two uh then that number gets multiplied pretty quickly into this profit and I also experiened some uh very hard limits so I can only bet you know sometimes $5 doll on certain player props because the Sports books don't want my action anymore so obviously if I'm placing $ five bets uh my you know dollar per click is going to go way down uh than if I could get off you know $500 per bet but real cool little exercise here cool to see that every time click a button I'm making

$214 in the next video we're going to talk about the Kelly Criterion formula which is a Formula designed to place optimal bet sizes that will increase your bankroll growth and decrease the downswings of sports betting now this uses the expected value that we just calculated along with the implied win probability to determine that bet size so check out this next video to learn more about the Kelly Criterion formula thanks for watching
