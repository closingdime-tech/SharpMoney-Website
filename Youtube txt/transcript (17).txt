welcome in guys my name is Robbie and this is the sharp money positive EV sports betting course episode 2.1 we just finished up chapter one which was all the introductions about a sports betting and myself now we're moving on to chapter two which is all the basics of sports betting we're going to go over a lot of the common terms that you'll hear with Prof sports betting Concepts and a lot of just like the basic strategies not going to go into any crazy detail here but you're going to get a good base of information uh to expand your knowledge with so this episode right here is all going to be about you know what is positive EV betting plus EV sports betting stands for positive expected value sports betting now this is a term that is typically used to describe a top down betting strategy which is what this course is all about it's all about top- down strategies but plus EV betting doesn't necessarily mean you're just talking about top down plus EV betting is literally anyone that is calculating an edge with their bet has a positive expected value meaning that if they place this bet at a certain win probability with the correct odds then long term their bet will be profal meaning it is a plus EV bet but top down has kind of just coined the term plus EV betting which is kind of weird because even if you're originating your own lines or you know even if you're playing blackjack with an edge it's all plus EV betting realistic realistically but a lot of people just refer to it as top down top down betting requires actually no knowledge of the sports that you're betting into it's more about viewing the sports betting Market as a financial market and knowing that the market is efficient and understanding how it moves uh with so with top down strategies you really don't need to understand Sports at all to be able to make money sports betting it's more like stock trading where you're looking at different probabilities and different prices and kind of when to buy into a market when to sell out of a market and things like that honestly some times I think it's better off that you don't know anything about the sport you're betting into because a lot of the time your own thoughts of the outcomes of the game are wrong and they influence the way you want to bet so honestly you're better off not knowing anything about sports but when you're top down betting you have to understand that you are not smarter than the market as a whole right the market is more efficient than you they have more information than I do so I'm not going to beat them by you know I don't have any information that the market does not have that's the Assumption of a top down better so instead of trying to produce our own numbers to beat the market we use the market in the sports books kind of against themselves nowadays there are so many different sports books out there and they're offering so many markets like FanDuel might have 1,000 different markets I can bet into just on a one given day of betting the MBA there's no way that every single sports book can keep accurate odds and prices across all the crazy markets they offer right now because there's just so many markets to cover it just can't be accurate everywhere so basically what we're doing is we're looking for outliers in the market that is probably the bread and butter of positive EV sports betting or top down betting is literally if 10 books agree on a certain price let's just say it's Patriots Plus one0 for their money line bet 10 books have that plus 110 and then all of a sudden you see one book sitting at plus 130 then you know that the market is mostly efficient and they're mostly sitting on plus 110 so that the Plus 13 line is off and you can pretty much blindly bet that plus 130 number and make a long-term profit when you're top down betting you can assume that you'll make between 1 and 3% Roi now that seems like a small margin but if you're able to scale your bankroll and reinvest all of your profits you can grow insanely quick even with a one or two% uh Roi long term the reason that the margins are kind of small is like I said earlier the markets are efficient the sports betting Market is efficient but with inside this very efficient market there are slim edges to be grabbed and that's where top down betting comes in like that example earlier where I was saying the whole Market was sitting at plus 110 and there was an outlier book at plus 130 typically these books will not leave themselves priced as an outlier for very long because they know the market is correct so if you're not able to place that wager within only a couple minutes of the misprice line showing up then most likely that book will also correct to plus 110 and that plus 130 number will be gone forever I want to keep this video pretty simple so I'm not going into a crazy amount of detail about these top- down strategies but what I will say is I've identified three different top- down strategies the first one that we just talked about I would call this like the market average strategy assuming that the majority of the books are the source of Truth and then finding an outlier compared to that book the second strategy which I like a lot is identifying sharp Sports books and then comparing their lines to other books which means instead of using a whole Market average as your truth of source you're using a small group of one two or three different books to set the fair value of the line and then compare that to the rest of the market using a you know a sharp book strategy gives you the option to bet into multiple different retail books instead of the outlier strategy where just one um obviously we'll get into some of the you know the concepts here but basically there's ways to identify sharp Sports books in certain categories in certain markets and then use their prices and their odds against other books but this is a great strategy that I use all the time and we'll get into a lot more detail about this later in the course the third strategy that I use top down betting and my absolute favorite is called steam chasing what it's often referred to as and this is basically identifying in which way the market is moving and playing edges within the moving market now markets that are moving whether it's a financial Market or the sports betting Market that's where you find discrepancies in lines and prices and that's where you can find the most value so I love using the line movement of either the Shar books or the market as a whole and kind of just getting in at a good point to where the market continues moving that direction and ends up getting me a lot of closing line value or I just get a really good price compared to what the final number is for that sporting event and it's great because steam chasing gives you the ability to play like very small edges like under one 1% edges I will play if I can see that the market is moving heavily in One Direction so not only can you play small edges but those small edges that you play often turn out to be the biggest edges right before b game time because if I see let's just say we see a Celtics line and they're minus5 earlier in the day and now they move to - 6 - 7 - 8 without me even knowing what's going on with you know within that market I can basically assume that someone on the team they're playing against probably got injured and this line is moving towards the Celtics so if I can get in there early and the market continues to steam in that direction then I'm GNA have a lot of closing line value and just like I said a great number before the game starts I hope that all made sense to you guys like I said we are going to go into so much more depth about each of these strategies each of the concepts and terms inside of these strategies but I just wanted to paint a bigger picture of what you know positive EV betting is what top down betting is and what this course is going to be about so in this next video we're going to start getting into some of the uh the terms that you might hear so the next video will be all about The Vig and if you don't know what The Vig is then make sure
