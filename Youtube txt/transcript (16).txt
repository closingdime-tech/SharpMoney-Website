welcome into the sharp money positive EV sports betting course this is episode 1.3 and today I'm going to talk about the sports betting industry I'm going to break this video into three different categories the first category we will just talk about the sports betting industry as a whole why I think the industry as a whole is honestly terrible then we'll break down the types of communities you'll find in this industry and then we'll go as far as breaking down the type of individuals you'll find in this community so I hope you guys like this video if you haven't checked out episodes 1 and two go watch that before you start this one all right let's go let's first talk about the sports betting industry and before I absolutely rip them apart for everything they do wrong let's just talk about some of the numbers and the sports betting industry's growth over the last few years so right now it is 2025 and there sports betting is legal in 38 different states I suspect that in the course of the next 5 to 10 years that pretty much every state will legalize it I'm not sure why a lot of states are holding back maybe we'll get a coule that just won't pull the trigger on it because of some other laws they have going on but for the most part I think just about every state will eventually legalize sports betting so we're still in the growth stage where not every state is legal yet with that being said in 2023 there was9 billion do wagered on sports betting by the general public which was a 28% increase from the year prior of 2022 so we've increased on how much was bet by 27 7% year-over-year right now and as more States become legal I'm sure this number is going to continue to climb uh the other big thing is the sports books have increased their overall profit per bet in the last year too um books typically profited 1.8% in 2022 and now they're averaging 99.1% in 2023 so that means for every $100 you bet in 2023 you're expected to lose $9 which is just a crazy Roi for the sports books um I don't know if that number will scale forever eventually we'll have to stop but we'll get into that later and another big movement in this industry is the same game parlay and parlays in general so in 2023 19% of all bets placed were same game parlay which was a 6% increase from last year so they went from 133% up to 19% of all the bets coming in are same game parlays why do Sports books want same game parlays and why are they pushing so much every time you log into the sports books well the sports books are making 18% Roi on the same game parlay as you guys are betting right now so we were just talking about them making a 9% profit on you know the blanket of every bet placed but if you're betting same game parlays they are pulling in an 18% Roi so that's why they're pushing it so hard on the general public now this is up 5% from last year so last year they were making 133% on same game parlays and now they're making 18% so either they're adding more juice or they're just pushing more people towards that maybe the the general public are just adding more legs and making worse bets either way the sports betting books are seeing you know a real reason to push these same game parlays because people love them and they're just losing so much money so we'll get into that later now that we've talked about some of the stats behind the sports betting industry and kind of How It's scaling up so quick let's talk about the negative effects that the sports betting industry had has on a lot of people and why it is such a terrible industry as a whole honestly I think there are a lot of good things to be pulled out of this industry but as a whole I think this is honestly terrible for the general public that online gambling especially iig gaming is now legal uh first of all let's just talk about how the sports books handle winners and losers someone like myself on a retail sports book since I'm a proven winner they will only let me bet sometimes Pennies on certain markets meanwhile if if I have someone they have someone that is losing a bunch of money they will be able to bet thousands of dollars or even increase their limits on certain markets so overall the sports better the sports books are literally just targeting losing BS and trying to take as much money from as them as possible and they are not letting people like myself bet into their sports book now there needs to be some type of Middle Ground here completely eliminating sharp bets and just taking everyone's money that is betting for funds is completely wrong there has to be some better way to do it in my opinion the worst part about this industry is the fact that it's introducing gambling addiction to hundreds of thousands of people right now 3% of the general public shows some signs of gambling addiction and I'm assuming that number is going to Skyrocket once it's legal in every single state now also the majority of people betting are young men under the age of 35 and another study has shown that about 10% % of young males have shown signs of gambling addiction now the problem with sports betting is or online sports betting is you no longer have to plan a trip to go to Vegas or your local casino where you can bring a reasonable reasonable amount of money and go there and waste it if I want to go to the casino plan the trip you know I'll bring $500 and if I lose that money no big deal but now I can log onto my phone in the matter of seconds in place I could dump my whole savings account into my FanDuel account and put it on some random team to win now I personally don't think I'll ever do this but a lot of people will get to some point in their life where they are down so bad and they have nothing to lose they will just dump their entire life savings on a bet and lose it and they'll never be able to financially recover from that or let's just say you had too many drinks one night and you bet way more than you should have um you're going to wake up the next morning realizing hey it's going to take me years to save up this money I just just lost now a lot of people will end up in those situations whether you like it or not it's just the reality of it now that it's so easy to bet so much so quickly it's going to happen and it's going to continue to to grow as more States introduce sports betting and online gaming not only can you wager an insane amount of money and lose it you know in one bet I think a lot of people might not think they have a gambling problem and let's just say you know you're you're skating by paying your bills every month but you're losing $100 a week sports betting now that that's a problem you don't have that extra $100 a week to lose if you are barely paying the bills so you might think that hey 100 bucks a week is not a big deal but at the end of the year that's $5,200 and if you do it for the next 10 years of your life you just gave away $52,000 so people don't think that you know they think they can lose a little bit of money for entertainment purposes and there are people that can bet responsibly and have the money to lose but honestly most of America I don't think they have an extra $100 a week to to lose um with all that being said a lot of these gambling problems and a lot of these people spending money that they don't have is the major reason why I can make so much money sports betting so it's kind of this double-edged sword where without them I wouldn't exist and these Sports books wouldn't exist it puts everyone in a kind of it's a weird situation to be in I don't feel like I am directly affecting people betting because I'm making money um so I you know I don't view it poorly but it is something I kind of think about all right that was a ton of negative stuff thrown out you about the sports betting industry and while I stand firm on my opinion that sports betting as a whole for the general public is very bad about 75% of the people are probably going to experience uh something bad with sports betting the other half the population or the other quarter of the population are either people like myself that now have a new way to make money doing something they love uh as a part-time job as a full-time job or just a side Hustle I think it is really cool to be able to make some money sports betting doing something that is fun um so I view it as a positive there um and if you can just gamble responsibly then you now have a new source of entertainment that you didn't have to be able to go place a respon a responsible wager on you know the Dolphins Jets game that you wouldn't care about regularly and now you have an entertainment factor to it it's great I think it is good for everyone um you know it brings extra joy in your life to have entertainment so if you can gamble responsibly and make reasonable Wagers then yes sports betting is is awesome to have now the other positive with sports betting becoming legal in the United States is now the individual states have extra taxable Revenue uh to produce more income for the state now I don't know what the government does with all this extra gambling money I don't think in my state I'll ever see a reduction in my taxes or they'll they'll probably just dump it into you know improving the state but all that is a positive I don't know exactly what they do with it but now the state has more money to hopefully make improvements and benefit my life somehow now all this other money was all this gambling money was either going to you know illegal gambling operations like bookies and stuff like that or the offshore books like B online and bada so now the state gets a chunk of that money and hopefully do something good with it so that basically wraps up a lot of my general thoughts on the sports betting industry as a whole I have a lot more to say about it but we'll get into some of the more Concepts in my thought process as the video goes on or as these courses go on the second thing I wanted to talk about was these sports betting communities inside of the sports betting industry and there's a hard line between two communities we have the what I would call the recreational bers on one side and then the sharp betting community on the other side and I'll give you a quick layout of both so the sharp side of sports betting will be the people that are actually profitable actually doing this for a full-time part-time job their content that they're making is going to be less appealing to the general public because it's not flashy showing you their new Lamborghini and their stacks of hundreds uh they're not emotional they're not throwing their TV against the wall the wall when one of their bets loses because they've lost a million bets in their life they know that one bet doesn't determine whether you're a good better or not or really even affect your bank role in the long term uh they're not celebrating huge wins because they have huge wins all the time um so a lot of that that the wck betters like to see all that emotion the sharp side doesn't have a lot of these sharp betters actually have real edges that they don't actually want to share with the general public um so they're going to keep their cards close to their chest because if they give away their Edge to the general public that edge will no longer be there they won't be able to make money sports betting so the sharp side of the community is they're less emotional I would say they're much smarter um but they're way less entertaining on the other side you have the wreck bets which probably makes up at least 90% of all the sports betting communities these are people some of these communities are are great places where they are responsible gambling and they're giving you fun bets to place and you know it's it's a tight Niche Community um where you can gain friends and really make connections and enjoy sports betting together the problem is that a lot of these recreational sports betting communities they're not portraying thems as recreational they're trying to prove to you that they are profitable and sharp Sports bets even though they're not and this leads to a big issue to where you start paying for someone's service because you think they're profitable so now you're losing money because you're paying for their service and they're giving you terrible picks that lose in the long term so it's a double negative there and that's where my biggest issue is if you are running some type of community where you are kind of identifying as a sharp community and you're not not actually producing long-term profits or you're lying about the profits that's where uh you know that that's where such the negativity comes from when I view cappers like that's just my first thought but there are a lot of recreational communities out there that are transparent with like hey we're just trying to find edges we don't really know if we have an edge but we're having fun we're building a community we're winning and losing our bets together that can be a lot of fun and that falls into you know the responsible gaming side of things and you know having fun sports betting that's awesome like a lot of people just want to bet for entertainment and there are some great communities out there to do that the problem is those communities get overlapped with the communities that are just selling bad pcks and you know producing really you know a bad product so I do see that the recreational side of sports betting does have a lot of positives but there's also a lot of negatives within that space I don't want my negative thoughts on a few different cappers and a few different communities to you know the picture of the entire Community because the recreational Community can be great as long as they're transparent with their customers I've just seen it uh time and time again where people discover profile sports betting they tell me these horror stories of them paying for picks uh to a losing better that was straight up just lying about their Edge lying about their overall profits for their lifetime and things like that so it does put a bad taste in my mouth of the Recreational Sports Better Community but there are also a lot of great members in that community and a lot lot of you know great communities to be to be a part of so the hard part for a lot of people starting out is to actually identify where the split is who is recreational and who is sharp now it's actually really hard to find the sharp betting Community it's not there's no really huge names in the the sharp side of sports betting like I said they're the sharp bets aren't producing as much content not nearly as much content the content is way less entertaining so it doesn't get blown up on on Twitter and um all the other social media Pages because it's just less entertainment so you need to actually like really go out of your way to find the sharp betting Community it's funny I've been uh you know sharp sports betting for a couple years now and I feel like I just found the sharp betting community on Twitter like I just started following a lot of sharp betters and that I didn't know ever existed just because their pages are so much smaller than these big people selling you know garbage picks it's just funny how that works but the sharp betting Community is very small but the people in there are mostly great the last thing I want to talk about is the type of individual and their thought process inside of the sports betting industry right now so 97% of sports betters right now are not profitable which means that 3% obviously are and I don't necessarily think that 3% of sports bets are actually sharp I think that there is probably one or two% out of that 3% that is just profitable right now but doesn't actually mean they have an edge you could have hit a $10,000 parlay that was a terrible bet but it actually hit and now you're profitable for the next couple years but realistically you never had Edge so with inside of the winners or the profitable bers I think there's probably only one or two% of the whole general public that are actually sharp and beding with edges um right now the individual better is s or 75% male right now and I believe believe that number is probably actually more if you're looking at just betting accounts um a lot of the husbands or boyfriends make accounts for their girlfriends which probably account to uh 25% of the population be girls that's just my opinion Maybe I'm Wrong maybe it is 25% of the population betting are women but in my opinion it's probably it's probably less than that about 40% of the betters are under the age of 35 so you're getting this uh it's a lot of younger people between 18 and 35 years old that are new to the space and still learning and we've seen this evolution of betters betting tons of parlay I think over 75% of the bets placed now are parlays um a lot of the like we were just talking about earlier in the video same game parlays are kind of exploding um another thing with individual sports betters is they think in absolutes instead of uh probabilities so you might think you might hear this from a wreck batter where hey the Chiefs are 100 100% going to win today they are not losing to the Rams meanwhile a sharp better would say you know the Chiefs have a 73% chance of winning uh it's just a a big difference you need to be able to assign a win probability um instead of thinking in absolutes but the general public mostly just think in absolutes of this bets either winning or losing they don't think about probabilities uh they also don't understand the that sample size is so important uh someone could easily convin like send you 10 picks and they could go 10 and0 that that person might not have an edge and they'll go 10 and0 and then someone could send you another 10 picks and they could go 0 and 10 uh people think that a small sample size determines whether you're good better or not realistically you need to see probably about a thousand bets within one certain category to even consider them sharp or profitable so me sending you 10 bets and going 10 and0 doesn't mean I'm any good at betting but the general public thinks that if you can pick 10 bets in a roow that you are insanely Smart in this field uh people are also not price sensitive right now and what I mean by that is they'll bet something at minus 120 when they can find it on a different sports book at minus 110 they just don't think that 10 cents differ really matters in the long term that's like a 5% Edge that you're giving up just by giving up 10 cents so the general public just does doesn't understand how important uh the price differences are across the books uh so that's something we'll talk about later and then really the big thing is that people don't understand that knowing sports or knowing ball is completely different than knowing sports betting right that's why you see on ESPN and all these other big TV networks that you they have these Sports analysts that are selling you basically selling you picks right before the game starts uh they're picking a certain team money line they're not even talking about what price it is they're just making picks because they know Sports well I'm telling you right now you could know a lot about sports and you could be a terrible sports better and then on the flip side of it uh someone like myself I can make a ton of money betting tennis and I have never really watched the full tennis match so sports betting and and the knowledge of sports are are very separate and a lot of people do not understand that um there's a reason that a lot of these sports betting networks are advertised by DraftKings and fanuel it's because they're just having a bunch of random people basically sell you on pick out or not profitable um especially if it's right before game time you're never going to find an edge there that's a different story and then the other thing that I love that these uh Sports books do is just because they throw a celebrity's face on some parlay does not make it good and people just love betting like hey uh you know Dave poro is on this three-leg parlay I have to tail it and a lot of people might think because you know he's big into the sports betting industry or he's big into the sports industry that his pcks are going to be good they're not they're garbage and that's the reason they're putting their his face on a random parlay is because the sports book thinks that more people will take that terrible bet because his faces on it so yeah that basically wraps up this video I mean it's it was a lot of information here I feel like I could have broken this video down a little bit more but this concludes the end of the chapter one which was the introduction and so chapter number two will be going over some of the basic concepts of sports betting I'm really excited to get into it appreciate you guys watching
