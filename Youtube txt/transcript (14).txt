welcome to the sharp money positive EV sports betting course my name is Robbie and I'm going to teach you how to make a consistent income from sports betting now in a community full of misinformation and frauds I'm going to do my best to be 100% honest and transparent with you guys throughout this course really no [ __ ] the truth is that more than 50% of the people that complete this course or even are watching this video will never become profit Sports betters there's a reason that only 1% of all sports betters are profitable and it's because a lot of the general public lacks the abilities um that a lot of profile Sports bets have a lot of you guys will give up because you're it's too much effort to put into sports betting a lot of you will give up because you don't understand some of the math concepts uh maybe you just think that profitable sports betting is boring and takes the fun out of sports betting there's a lot of reasons that people uh will fail and not become profit Sports bets it takes a certain mindset and a certain person that is willing to learn to actually become profitable with that being said I do believe just about anyone can be a profit Sports better as long as they're committed to the process what I can promise you is that if you complete this course you'll never view sports betting the same again once I learned a lot of these Prof full sports betting Concepts my mindset or the way I viewed sports did a complete 180 I completely view Sports and sports betting uh completely differently now the other thing I can promise you that if you complete this course you'll be smarter or more educated than 99% of the the people that are betting into these Sports books so you'll have a big leg up on the other customers by completing this course you'll have a real opportunity to make a life-changing amount of money sports betting for some of you it might be making an extra couple hundred dollar a month to help with bills to others it might be turning this into a full-time job and making thousands of dollars every month when I first started sports betting my goal was to make you know $2 to $300 a month quickly I learned after making thousands of dollars over the course of the first few months that this could be more than just a little bit of a side hustle to me and now it's kind of a part-time job so for me sports betting has been life changing in a lot of ways whether you are brand new to sports betting or consider yourself an expert I believe this course will provide value to an array of different sports betters now as an expert you might find some of these videos to be a little bit basic but as we progress throughout this course the concepts will become more advanced and just getting a different perspective from you know another profile Sports better I think can add a lot of value even if you kind of think you already know a lot of the answers so I'm going to lay out the course right now and how exactly it's going to be um delivered to you guys and what you can kind of expect so this course will be broken down into five different chapters each chapter will kind of get more advanced as we go uh chapter one will be an introduction and inside of this will be a series of videos uh number one will be this video the course introduction which I'm going to go and lay out the rest of the of course the second
