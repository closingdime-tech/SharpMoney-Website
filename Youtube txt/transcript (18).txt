welcome in guys my name is Robbie this is episode 2.2 of the sharp money positive EV sports betting course and today we're going to talk about a really important term to understand and that is the vigorish now this term is also referred to as The Vig the fee the tax the hold the house Edge whatever you want to call it it's basically the feed that the sports book charge the sports bers to guarantee they make a profit long term now the most obvious example here is when you see a sporting event price at minus 110 on both sides of the line that means the person wagering needs to place a $110 wager just to win $100 in return this gives a pretty good Edge to the sports book and allows them to make money long term as a profal sports better I need to be placing bets that overcome The Vig so my edges need to be more than The Vig that I'm going to pay on my winnings if I simply win 50 1% of the time betting minus 110 lines because I have to pay the extra Vig winning more than half the time isn't going to be profitable you actually need to win 52.38% of the time just to be profitable betting minus 110 lines because The Vig on a minus 110 line is 4.76% so simply winning 51% of the time is not going to be enough to be profitable because they are taking the tax away from you the sports book's Main main goal is to produce a spread or a total that will win or lose 50% of the time no matter what side you bet on it right because if they're able to produce a really accurate spread or total that longterm people are winning and losing 50% of the time on and they're charging that 4.76% Vig then they will end up making 4.76% in profit so if they can maintain an accurate line then they obviously will take in exactly what they charge for the tax now we can kind of use this against the sports book because they in certain markets the Sportsbook will add more viig to their line like I said minus 110- 110 is 4.76 but if you see lines priced at minus 120us 120 The Vig is much higher meaning if if you're blindly betting into these markets you're giving up a ton of extra viig and taxes to them right but this also tells me that the sports book is not confident in their lines that they need to set a really high percent of Vig to cover you know the inaccuracy of their line when it comes to spreads and money lines and totals The Vig is usually pretty tight and pretty small because they're confident in producing that type of line but if we're talking about an NBA player prop where it's a bench player to score over under a certain amount of points the books aren't as accurate producing that line so they have to add more Vic so yes it's harder to overcome The Vig there but we know that market is exploitable because they are kind of showing a sign of weakness by adding more Vig into that market basically saying hey we don't know we don't know exactly what this number should be set at so we are going to raise our Vig percentage so that we have a little bit of a buffer room to be wrong on this one in the last video I talked about how top down betting strategies often use sharp books to identify the fair value of a line and then compare it to other books now a good indicator of a Sharp book or a sharp Market would be a low Vig percentage in that book or market so for example there are three pretty sharp books we'll get into this in much more detail but bookmaker Circa and Pinnacle a lot of their Mainline spreads and totals they'll only charge minus 105 on each side of the line or minus 108 instead of minus 110 like FanDuel draftking Caesars and all other retail books do so that's a clear indicator that the markets are more accurate and Tighter on the sharp books because they don't need that much Vig to make money as in a retail book that needs to take a 4.67% hold to actually make a profit in the first chapter of this course we talked about how much money the sports books are actually making and that's about 99.1% Roi on every dollar that is BET into their book and you might ask yourself hey if they're only charging 4.7 76% Vig how are they making over 9% profits well it's because of the parlays we talked about how parlays are growing in popularity for the customers that are betting into the sports book but essentially how a parlay works is if you are placing multiple Wagers and banking on them all to hit then you are just adding The Vig of each bet into this this this one wager so for an example if we're say we're betting a money line parlay and each leg that we are adding or each bet that we're adding has a 5% in fig if I build a four-leg parlay then I just added four separate bets together in this parlay that each bring a 5% Vig with them so now this total bet this total parlay has 20% Vig baked in there so if I bet $100 I'm expected to only return $80 back the sports book would make 20% on that wager long term now obviously with the mix of straight bets and parlays that's where the 99.1% comes from that's their rake that's you know the hold of The Vig that they collect from people betting into them let's look at a couple more markets and see the big percentage Within These markets hopefully by talking through this and explaining these numbers you will look at the betting Market completely different and hopefully never want to place a degenerate bet again just blindly into these markets because you know how much Vig uh is baked into them so like we said earlier minus 110 10 minus 110 Market you're giving up 4.76% okay that's reasonable it's not crazy high uh no big deal to place a few bets like that you often will see these minus 115 minus 115 markets on player props so that's the next one we're going to talk about and this is a 6.98% hold now this number is getting a little scary I don't want to give up close to 7% of my money every time I bet now obviously this is only if you're betting without an edge and just blindly betting we can bet into these markets with edges you'll know how to I'll explain how to do that later in the video so you also see these minus 120us 120 markets these could be on like of the Olympic events like events that the books really have no idea what's going on and you're giving up about a 99.1% edge by betting into these minus 120 markets so scary numbers to give up that big of a percent of your money if you placed 10 Wagers at minus 120us markets then you'll basically be broke by the time your 10 Wagers are settled which is kind of insane but yeah just wanted to show you guys how much viig is actually baked into some of these markets even if the difference between oneus 110 and minus10 doesn't scare you it really should it's a it's a big difference in the next video we're going to talk about the implied win probability that a set of odds tells us now just like a set of odds tells us the certain V percentage in that market it also tells us the win probability that a sports book is assigning to a certain bet which is extremely useful when it comes to Prof sports betting the next couple videos we also go into how to calculate the vid how to calculate the implied win probability and no no Vig Fair odds and things like that and we can finally break out this whiteboard and and put it to the test so click on the next video to learn more about the implied win probabilities
