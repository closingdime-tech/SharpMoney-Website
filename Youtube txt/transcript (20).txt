welcome in guys my name is Robbie this is the sharp money positive EV sports betting course episode 2.4 and we're going to talk about the most important term that you need to understand when you're profitable sports betting or top down betting and that is the no viig fair odds also known as the true odds or the uh fair value of a line so basically we've talked in the last couple videos about The Vig and implied win probability but essentially what the fair value is or the noig fair odds is just taking a set of odds sports book gives us and then removing The Vig from that line like we talked about earlier too every set of odds has an implied win probability so if we can remove The Vig and find a fair value or no Vig line then we can take that set of odds and find an implied win probability which is kind of the you know the true value of a line and then compare that to the other books so this is an very very important process in profitable sports betting being able to remove The Vig from a line and then compare that true line or that fair value to the rest of the market there are four different methods used to deving a line or taking The Vig out and the reason there are so many different methods to it and it's not just cut and dry like one method works and the others don't is because we don't know exactly where The Vig or the extra juice is placed whether that's on the plus side of the bet or the negative side of the bet we don't know where that Vig actually is so we can use different methods to determine you know worst case scenario and then use that worst case scenario deig lines to compare it to other books for this example we're going to be talking about the multiplicative method which is the most common method used across the industry and it's really good for odds under plus 200 but there's also the additive method the shin method and the power method those are more complex uh methods to use for deving lines we'll talk about them in later videos more advanced videos but today we'll be talking about just using the multiplicative method method and how to devid using that before we get into any of the math I'm just going to use a real example of using noig Fair odds to find Value in the market so the first thing you have to do is find a book that you trust who sets really accurate lines for a certain market so for major markets especially in the NFL Circa sports book has historically set very accurate odds so we want to use the Circa odds deig their odds to find the true value of that line and then compare the sharp sports book fair value compared to the rest of the market so let's just do this for an example we have Patriots plus seven and circus sets this line at minus 110 on both sides if we remove The Vig from that line then the true value of that line will be plus 100 because it's minus 110 on each side basically just means Circa thinks that the Patriots will cover plus s points 50% time 50% of the time is equivalent to the plus 100 odds that they that with the fair value would be so now we know that Circa has Patriots plus seven at fair value of plus 100 odds or 50% win probability now we see that FanDuel has the Patriots plus seven but they are paying plus 105 for that line so we can go on to FanDuel we know we're going to win this bet about 50% of the time because that's where the Circa fair value line put us but we're getting paid out plus 105 instead of plus 100 so if you can beat the fair value price then you have a good play or positive EV play so if fair value is plus 100 and we can find a plus 105 then we have a positive EV play but if fair value is plus 100 and we see a line at minus 105 then that is going to be a negative EV play so just a quick example there and I will break it down on the board real life example and walk you guys through it again okay now we're going to break down the formula for finding the fair value of a line um in this example we're going to use the multiplicative method to deig which is the most simple method and also the most commonly used in industry so it's a good one to show you guys EXA exactly how it works but basically the formula is the fair value equals the implied odds divided by the total implied odds and if you watched the last video we went over how to calculate implied win probability so if you we're going to skip that step here because we already went over in the last video and let's just look at a different set of odds here to to find our fair value so when you're finding fair value you want to use a sharp book or a combination of sharp books odds to find your fair value because you want an obviously a sharp book that has accurate lines to compare to the rest of the market so for this example we'll call it cira sports book and they have very sharp NFL line so let's just say they have this line posted Patriots plus 7 atus 150 and the Chiefs - 7 and + 130 so we need to find the implied when probability of -150 and plus 130 so we'll do that over here I will minus 150 is going to equal a 60% win probability 60 as a decimal or 60% and then plus 130 equals 43 old [Music] 4348 or as a win percentage

43.48% and that is your Vig right so if we take our calculator out here actually we don't really need a calculator for this but we take 60% plus the 43.4% and that's going to give us a number of 103.4 eight% which basically means every set a fair value line will always add up to 100% or you know uh 1.0 in decimal form so this extra if we subtract 100 this is going to be our Vig so 3.48% that is the amount of Vig set in a line that is priced at -50 plus 130 so basically we know how much Vig is in this line now we're going to use the multiplicative method to actually remove that Vig so we'll solve for the minus 150 first so we need the implied odds the implied odds are 60 we didn't do the math out there to solve for the implied wiim probability but we did it in the other videos so we're not going to go into it uh the total implied ODS would be this number but as a decimal so it would just be

1.03 4 8 and that will give us the fair value or the wind prob the fair value wind probability here so let's do 60 and we will divide it by 1.03 48 and that will give us57

98 22 I don't want to go too crazy here so that is the implied win probability of the no viig fair odds of this minus 150 line here um basically this if you times this by 100 you'll get a win probability so we're talking about a

57.9% win probability on this minus 150 line so now we need to also solve for the other side of it and basically what should happen is both of these percentages should now add up to plus 100 which means The Vig will be completely gone instead of us getting this plus uh this 103 number with the extra VG in there so same thing there's no different formula here fair value equals the implied odds over here it is 4348 divided by the total implied odds which is right there 1.03 48

clear the calculator 43 48 divided by 1.0 348 and that will equal.

4217 uh which you know is equivalent to a

42.0 or 42 almost 1% and if you if you add those up you'll get exactly 100 all right now we have the fair value and win probability right so a minus 150 plus 130 line the minus 150 side will win 57.9% of the time and the plus 130 side will win 42.0% of the time now we have some more work to do here to get these back to American odds to be able to compare to the rest of the books so basically what we need to do is take these implied win probabilities and now turn them into decimal odds and then convert decimal odds into American odds so the first step here it's it's really simple to convert these implied win probabilities into decimal odds honestly decimal odds are we don't use them here in America but a lot of other sports Books use them in different countries and it's honestly just easier because anything you do with sports betting math pretty much always you always have to convert it to decimal odds so it's nice that most um other countries just start with decimal odds I think that makes the most sense so what we have to do here is we take one divided by the the fair value here so for this minus 150 line we're just taking one divided by 0579 8 22 and this is going to equal our decimal odd so 1 / 0.5 7 99 822 is going to give us one .7 245 we don't want to go crazy here but this is the fair value decimal odds now of the Patriots at minus 150 okay and then we'll do the same thing for the other side 1 divid by.

4348 1 ided 4348 and that will equal 2.2 9 9 now these are the fair value decimal odds so now let's go into the formula for turning decimal odds into American odds now we have the noig decimal odds and I realized in that last video I use the wrong numbers to calculate this bottom number so this is 2.38 representing the uh plus 130 um I I used the wrong number on the bottom equation here but now we have the no decimal odds now we need to convert decimal odds into American odds so we can compare to the rest of the market and American odds because I can't really look at decimal odds and understand what is going on so decimal odds to American odds of course they can't be simple there's two different formulas one formula is for odds decimal odds over greater two and the other formula is for decimal odds under two so we'll start with the one greater than two which is going to be the plus 130 line fair value is

2.38 as a decimal minus 1 * 100 will give us the American odds that's that's the formula for over two the decimal odds minus one in parentheses time 100 so real simple formulas here they're just a you know a pain to do but [Music] 2.38 minus 1 is going to equal 1.38

time 100 and that will give us times 100 here 138 or in American odds plus 138 which basically means that the no big Fair odds and American odds for this bottom number is plus 138 so if we find the Chiefs minus 7 on FanDuel and they're at plus 140 that is better than the noig American odds so that has value if the FanDuel has this line also at plus 130 it's it it's not a better odds than plus 138 so that would be a negative EV play um so we're going to solve over here and what we should get on this side is minus 138 because when it comes to fair value lines it is exactly the same on both sides so hopefully this side equals minus 138 so this formula for anything less than two in decimal odds is

00 divided by the decimal odds minus one in parentheses so we have the decimal odds are 1725 - 1 equals the American odds so inside the parentheses first 1725 minus 1 is going to equal

725 ided 100 so 100 / 725 equal

130 this this is a negative so this would be a negative number minus 13 7.98 it's that's- 138 we did it right so the fair value for this line - 150 + 130 is actually - 138 and + 138 so same thing on the other side of this equation if we see the Pats plus 7 at a better price than - 138 so like a -130 is now a better price because it has a better payout than our minus 138 and if we go some on FanDuel and we see this line at minus 145 then that is a worse price than our fair value line so determining the fair value price is the most important part of profit sports betting because this gives you a price to compare to the rest of the market now when you're top down betting use combination of different sports books or just one sharp book like circuit to find your fair value but your fair value can come from you know originating your own stuff and coming up with your own lines but basically that's a lot of the math that you need to know if you want to be a Prof Sports better all this stuff is automatic online with calculator so don't worry about it um so that's going to wrap this video up here
