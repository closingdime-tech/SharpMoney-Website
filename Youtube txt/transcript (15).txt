welcome to the sharp money positive EV sports betting course my name is Robbie some of you might know me by closing dime in this video we're going to talk about myself this is a self- inroduction video episode 1.2 and basically I'm making this video just so I can be more relatable to everyone watching this uh I'm not some crazy smart dude that has some crazy algorithms and is making money sports betting uh I did one year in college I was a pretty good student as's and B's but I wouldn't say I'm super smart I do pretty well with problem solving and math skills but I don't have any you know really continued education and I'm just trying to prove to you guys that anyone can make a lot of money sports betting so with that being said I want to just explain to you guys how I started sports betting how much I made what my goals are and all that so let's just start at the beginning I'm from Massachusetts and sports betting became legal about two years ago it was March of 2022 too a couple months before that I kind of knew that sports betting was going to get legalized there's a lot of talk about it being pushed through legislation and it sounded like it was good to go in March so before March I took a month or two to study up on profitable sports betting strategies and before I started looking into it I honestly had no idea what I would find and I came across different concepts one of them was positive EV sports betting the main reason I actually wanted to even start looking at being a profitable Sports better wasn't the fact that I really wanted to make crazy types of money sports betting it was just the fact that I absolutely loved Sports I absolutely loved gambling and sports betting was just this perfect matchup and I knew that over the next 50 years of my life I was going going to spend so much money sports betting if I didn't find a way to make it profitable or at least break even so it wasn't necessarily my mindset to discover you know really profitable strategies I was just trying to you know not lose my shirt over the long course of my life so anyway I discovered positive eveve betting on YouTube uh the first person I came across was the creator of OD Jam which is a positive EV betting service um Alex Monahan and he had some great videos I came across some of the other odds Jam users and really dove into uh watching a bunch of odd Jam videos and basically learning about positive eveve betting all through YouTube and I spent the first couple months before sports betting became legal just to kind of fill my brain with all this knowledge so I'll give those guys a lot of credit because they were you know really important to the development of me as a sports better so I started with $2,000 that I wanted to dedicate towards the sports betting journey and odds Jam at the time was about $200 a month so it was like 10% of my bankroll I was a little bit afraid that I was overpaying for a service because my bankroll was kind of small you know $22,000 might be a lot to some people it might be nothing to others so it's all relative but I was kind of worried that I wouldn't be able to cover the expense of odds Jam U after the first month or two I made like $2,000 the first month and another you know $1,500 the second month and I realized hey if I dedicate some time into the sports betting I for sure can make more money than I I really thought because at first I was literally just trying to cover that $200 odd Jam fee and then maybe make another1 or $200 on top of it and then I realized I could scale it up really far so after about a year I started really building my bank roll up I turned 2ou $2,000 into $32,000 my first year I believe and I actually ended up building a free Discord because at the time OD Jam had a Discord where if you don't know what Discord is basically a big chat Channel where everyone can communicate and odd Jam had a Discord and I learned so much from the people in that Discord and then about two or three months into my sports betting Journey they closed down this this odds Jam Discord so I decided to make one myself and I slowly started adding people in um I was posting on picket the link to join the Discord I was kind of going out of my way to find profile Sports betters and I ended up growing this Discord to 500 members at the time uh basically from nothing and I was a nobody but it was just this great community that was 100% free for everyone to use and we all just learned from each other and bounced ideas off each other and it was just such an important part of my journey is to just like have this space where I could come in and talk to people about positive orts betting and it was just a really great place after about the one year mark when I made $30,000 I realized I was pretty good at sports betting and I created my own YouTube channel and this was for a couple different reasons right around that one year mark I started to face some severe limits from the sports book where they won't let me bet a certain amount of money and I was worried that if these limits have like increased over the course of you know my sports betting Journey that maybe in the next couple years I will no longer be able to get down that much money and it just won't be worth my time and effort Just Sports bet anymore and honestly that idea kind of scared me so I wanted to get ahead of it because I always want to be part of the sports betting Community one way or the other so I started a YouTube channel about one year in uh the videos were pretty bad uh there's no edits there's you know there's not much to keep your attention besides me just talking and giving you guys good information um the camera quality was worse the lighting was worse than it is now uh but I gained a good amount of followers because I think that people could just relate to me I wasn't you know some crazy video editor I wasn't um some mathematical genius or anything like that I was just a normal guy trying to share my knowledge with everyone so my YouTube channel has grown to about 1,700 followers now in a little bit less than a year so I met Jay's plays and math wins on picket and they both joined my free Discord and and I realized they were both profile Sports bets uh really great guys to talk to and they just understood sports betting so well so I pitched them an idea of hey how about we build our own positive EV Bots we can program them and then run a Discord uh where we can have the Bots post plays in there and we can teach people how to use them and how to make money sports betting so we actually started a business together without ever meeting each other in person uh we've been in business for almost year together and it's gone great um the sharp money Discord has grown from a couple hundred members the first you know month or two to over 4,000 members in about six month span we've been growing so quickly we're always improving our positive EV Bots and we just built such a great Community um that is was really my goal is just to create a good Community where I can always be involved with sports betting and we also turned it into a business where we can help people out by giving them good positive plays and they obviously help us out in return by paying for the service and it just keeps me involved in the sports betting community no matter what happens in the future I will always be dedicated to teaching people how to make money sports betting uh so it's just a was a really big goal for me to get to this point and now we're at the point to where we're just trying to continue to educate people that's the whole reason I'm making this video is to really educate everyone and to either drive people into the sharp money disc ORD to continue learning uh to use our bot or if you don't feel like the Shar money Discord is right for you and there's other services like I'm I'm completely fine with that uh you know this isn't just to get people right into our Discord I'm really just trying to teach people how to make money sports betting and to prove that it can be done without too much effort I'm also a husband with two kids under three years old so they take up a ton of time I also work full-time uh 35 hours a week and I have a parttime job on top of that which is 5 to 10 hours a week for another sports betting company called outlier I Al I run the Shar money Discord uh so I talk you know multiple hours a week to different people explaining Concepts um all the business side of Shar money I'm involved in too so Shar money takes up so many hours during the week as well and I almost have I have a really limited amount of time every week to actually play sports bets um I've made like I said $55,000 in the past two years if I dedicated all of my time into just placing Sports bets I'm sure I could make over a 100,000 I see a lot of people doing it I just don't have the time for it and there's a lot of different Avenues which I've never touched like live betting Arbitrage betting middle betting I've just never done it it's all pregame stuff so I've never had that ability to really scale too far because of my time restraints but even with my time restraints U I was able to make you know a lot of money so I just want to prove to you guys that it does not take um you know you know you don't have to put away four hours every day to make money sports betting it can kind of be like I'm on my phone throughout the day placing bets as they show up uh I'm not really dedicating one block a time to find sports bets my goal in 2025 is just to continue to create content really start growing my YouTube and my pick it as much as possible along with just helping out everyone in the sharp money Discord by making this video it'll bring new members into the sharp money Discord and it will further educate a lot of the members that are already a part of sharp money so that was my Big Goal going forward is to creating more content and continue to grow my image on social media just to continue to grow the business and on top of that I want to obviously make as much money as possible sports betting but that might not be my number one priority or you know how much time I put into it um but there's a couple Avenues I would like to hit with sports betting um I haven't really touched offshore books yet um in the betting exchanges those are markets that I need to start hitting but a lot of my time will be focused on the content creation side appreciate you guys watching I know that what might have been boring to some people it's all about myself so this video really didn't have that much educational content it was really for you guys just to get to know me a little bit as a person I hope you guys enjoyed it uh next episode I'm really excited about it there's going to be some cool Concepts to talk about but I'm just going to talk kind of a broad overview of the sports betting space right now and what I think about it and what I think think of where it's going
