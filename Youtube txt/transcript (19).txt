welcome to episode 2.3 this is the sharp money positive EV sports betting course my name is Robbie and today we're going to talk about implied win probability why it's so important and how to actually do the math to calculate yourself now there are a lot of calculators out there so you won't actually have to do the math yourself when you're trying to find bets but it is important to understand how it works all the odds you see on a sports book they all have an implied win probability that is correlated with the set of odds it's B basically every odds has an implied win probability that is kind of the break even number of how many bets or percentage of bets you need to win betting at certain odds to break even the easiest example is if you're betting plus 100 Wagers or odds where you are putting $100 into a market and if you win you're returning exactly $100 of profit then that is a plus 100 odds bet and the implied win probability to a plus 100 odds bet is a 50% win probability because that is the break even number where if you win 50% of the time you know if i' hand you a 100 and lose it and then I win then you give me a 100 then it goes back and forth and it's break even long term uh so plus 100 odds would correlate with a 50% win probability so if I'm betting plus 100 odds I need my win probability to be over 50% to actually become profitable so if I'm betting plus 100 odds but my Edge is 51% or I'm winning or that I'm winning 51% of the time then I have an edge in that market betting plus 100 now this also obviously correlates throughout all the types of odds and we'll do the math in a little bit but I'll just explain uh the simple ones that you see uh typically if you're betting plus 150 odds then you need to win that bet 40% of the time to have an edge or to make money long term if you're betting plus 200 odds then you need to win that bet 33.33% of the time or more to make money uh with plus 200 odds that's a real quick description of what implied win probability is the next video we're going to talk about the noig fair odds which uses implied win probability and Vig to determine what the true value of a line should be and that is probably the most important thing to be able to calculate when you're profitable sports betting so it is really important for me to show you what Vig is and what implied win probability is before we talk about the no Vig Fair odds so before we do that though I'm going to break down the implied win probability formula on this whiteboard behind me and I'll show you guys the actual math like I said there are a lot of free calculators online you'll never have to do this by hand but it's just good to understand how it

works all right we have the Whiteboard out here and first we're going to solve for negative odds now there are two different formulas for finding the win probability uh this will just be for solving for American odds so there are negative and positive American odds obviously the positive odds being + 120 + 150 negative odds being minus 120 minus 150 so we're going to actually start with the negative odds here the formula is for negative odds the absolute value of the odds divided by the absolute value plus 100 in parentheses so first let's pick a random number here since this is a negative odds formula let's just pick minus 125 so if you don't know what the absolute value is it is just the value of the number as a positive or as a whole so the absolute value since we we're going to solve for minus 120 I'll just write that up there so the absolute value for minus 120 is 120 and then we need to divide that by the absolute value plus 100 so we have the absolute value which will also be 120 plus plus 100 will equal the implied win

probability the implied perent of women so pretty simple from here break the formula down one more time we're going to have 120 on the top still we have to solve for the bottom first since it's in parentheses so this will be

220 and simply on my calculator we we will solve this one so 120 / 220 equals. 545 as a decimal if we want to get this into a percentage we would just simply multiply by 100 which would give us

54.5% which is the win probability of a minus 120 line so if we are betting into minus 120 lines we need to win 54.5% of our bets to break even and if we want to make money we need to win more than 54.5% all right here's the formula for the positive odds to find the implied win probability of any positive odds on a sports book now before we get into it I first want to just apologize for this this big glare in the middle of the screen uh setting up the light setting up the camera is not my cup of tea I'm really not good at making these videos look great the quality is isn't perfect here but it's really not my cup of tea I'm more of a math guy in a sports better so I hope you guys can live with that little glare I'll try to avoid it for the most part it's bothering me right now but I'm sure it's bothering you watching it but all right let's get into this formula all right so real simple formula here for positive odds we take 100 divided by the odds plus 100 let's pick a random number here let's go with let's just pick one we'll go plus 160 so we plug it in we go 100 ided 160 plus 100 oh this is in parentheses I'm sorry we solve for the bottom first and that's going to give you your your win percentage so break it down one more step 100 divided by 260 do that on our calculator here 100 / 260 is going to

equal 384 if we multiply that by 100 to get it this decimal expressed as a a percentage it's going to equal

38.4% so we can say that plus 160 odds equals 38.4% meaning if you're betting plus 160 all we need to do is win 38.4% of our bets to break even anything above this win percentage is going to result in some long-term

profits that's going to wrap up this video on implied win probabilities next video we're going to talk about the noig fair odds how to calculate it and how to use it against different books to make money
